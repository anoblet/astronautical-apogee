Rename the chip-component to tag-component. Update all usages including class and slot names.

_**Assistant**_

Okay, I will rename the component and update its usages.

The component definition in `chip.ts` already uses the name `tag-component` for the custom element and `TagComponent` for the class. The main action will be to rename the file from `chip.ts` to `tag.ts`, update any imports, and ensure no old references exist.

First, I'll write the content of the existing `chip.ts` (which defines `tag-component`) into the empty `tag.ts`.
Then, I will delete the old `chip.ts` file.
Finally, I'll search for any remaining usages of `chip-component` or incorrect import paths and update them.

 Okay, I will proceed with renaming the component. Based on the file contents, it appears that `chip.ts` already defines the component as `tag-component` with the class `TagComponent`.

Here's the plan:
1.  Copy the content from `chip.ts` to `tag.ts`.
2.  Clear the content of `chip.ts` (as a way to "delete" it, since I can't directly delete files). I'll then advise you to delete it manually.
3.  Search for any files importing from `chip.ts` and update them to import from `tag.ts`.
4.  Since the component definition in `chip.ts` already uses `tag-component` for the custom element and `TagComponent` for the class, and has a generic slot, no further changes to the component's own code or its slot usage are expected.

Let's start by updating `tag.ts`.

The file `chip.ts` has been renamed to `tag.ts` and its content has been updated.

I will now search for usages of `chip-component` and update them to `tag-component`.

The `chip-component` has been renamed to `tag-component`. I've updated the component definition in `tag.ts` and all usages in `software.astro`. The old `chip.ts` file can now be deleted.
