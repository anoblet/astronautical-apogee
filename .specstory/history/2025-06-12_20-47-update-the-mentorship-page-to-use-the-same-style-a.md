Update the mentorship page to use the same style and structure as the other pages. Make sure the color scheme matches.

Copilot has been working on this problem for a while. It can continue to iterate, or you can send a new message to refine your prompt.

The current `mentorship.astro` page uses a custom Lit component and inline script, which is different from the simpler, more composable structure of the other pages (like `index.astro`, `services.astro`, and `portfolio.astro`). To match the style and structure:

- Move all content into the Astro template, using existing components (`card-component`, `contact-component`, etc.) directly.
- Remove the custom Lit component and inline script.
- Use the same class names and structure as other pages for consistency.
- Ensure color variables and layout match the global scheme.

I'll update `mentorship.astro` to follow this approach.

```

```

The mentorship page has been refactored to match the style and structure of the other pages, using Astro and existing components directly, and following the global color scheme.

However, there are some syntax errors due to the use of inline `style` attributes and possibly some copy-paste issues with HTML inside Astro. I will resolve these errors by moving all custom styles into a `<style>` block and ensuring the markup is valid Astro/HTML.

I'll fix these issues now.

```

The mentorship page has been updated to match the style and structure of the other pages. All custom styles are now in a `<style>` block, and the markup uses only valid Astro/HTML and existing components. The color scheme and layout are consistent with the rest of the site.

Let me know if you want to further refine the design or add any new features!

Remember to import the card component.

The card component is now properly imported at the top of the mentorship page. The component will be available for use throughout the page. Let me know if you need any further adjustments!
