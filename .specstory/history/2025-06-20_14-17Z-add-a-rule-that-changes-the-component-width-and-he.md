Add a rule that changes the component width and height to 2.5rem when on large devices.

I'll help you add a CSS rule to change the component width and height to 2.5rem on large devices. First, let me examine the current contact component to understand its structure. Now I'll check the global styles to understand what breakpoints are available for large devices. Let me continue reading the global styles to find the media query breakpoints: Let me read more of the global styles to understand the media query patterns used in this project: Based on the project structure, I can see that the media queries use `768px` as the breakpoint. For large devices, I'll use `@media (min-width: 769px)` to target devices larger than the mobile breakpoint. Now I'll add the CSS rule to change the component width and height to 2.5rem on large devices.

Now let me create/update the chat interaction file to save this conversation: Perfect! I've successfully added a CSS rule to the contact component that changes its width and height to 2.5rem on large devices. The rule uses `@media (min-width: 769px)` which follows the project's existing media query pattern where 768px is used as the breakpoint between mobile and desktop.

The rule is properly scoped to the component using `:host` within the media query, maintaining the component's encapsulated styling approach. On devices with a viewport width of 769px or larger, the contact component will now be 2.5rem × 2.5rem instead of the default 4rem × 4rem.
