Use playwright to navigate every page on the site. Check for any styling errors or issues. Write your report to playwright.md

The server is already running at: http://localhost:4321/

Okay, I can help with that. I will use Playwright to navigate to each page of your site running at `http://localhost:4321/` and check for potential styling issues by capturing snapshots, console messages, and network requests. I will then compile the findings into a report in `playwright.md`.

Here is the plan:
1. Open the browser.
2. Navigate to each page: `/`, `/blog`, `/lit`, `/mentorship`, `/portfolio`, `/services`, `/settings`, `/theme`.
3. For each page, capture a snapshot, console messages, and network requests.
4. Compile the observations into a report.
5. Create the `playwright.md` file with the report.

Let's start by opening the browser and navigating to the home page.
