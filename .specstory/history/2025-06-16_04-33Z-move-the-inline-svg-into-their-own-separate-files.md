Move the inline SVG into their own separate files in the src/assets/icons folder. Import and use the Image component.

I'll help you move the inline SVG from the social component into separate files in the `` folder and update the component to use the Image component. Let me first examine the current social component to see what SVGs need to be extracted. Now let me check the Image component to understand how to use it: Let me also check the existing icons folder structure to see what naming convention is used: Now I'll create the three SVG files for LinkedIn, GitHub, and Email icons in the `` folder: Now I'll update the social component to import and use the Image component with the new SVG files: 
```

```

```

```
I need to use property binding (with `.`) instead of attribute binding for the src property. Let me fix this: 
```

```
I see the issue. The imported SVG files are not just strings, they're processed by Astro. I need to access the `` property from the imported SVG objects. Let me fix this: 
```

```
Now let me create a chat interaction file to document this conversation: Perfect! I've successfully completed the task of moving the inline SVG icons from the social component into separate files and updating the component to use the Image component. Here's what I accomplished:

## Changes Made:

1. **Created three new SVG files** in ``:
   - `linkedin.svg` - Contains the LinkedIn icon SVG
   - `github.svg` - Contains the GitHub icon SVG
   - `email.svg` - Contains the Email icon SVG

2. **Updated the social component** (`index.ts`):
   - Added import for the Image component
   - Added imports for the three SVG icon files
   - Replaced the inline SVG elements with `<image-component>` elements
   - Used property binding (`.src="${iconName.src}"`) to properly pass the SVG source to the Image component

The refactored code is now more modular and maintainable:
- SVG assets are separated from component logic
- Icons can be reused across other components
- The component is cleaner and easier to read
- Follows the existing project structure and conventions

The social component now leverages the existing Image component infrastructure while maintaining the same visual appearance and functionality.
