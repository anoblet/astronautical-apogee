I'll analyze the existing pages in the `` directory to understand the brand aesthetic and then create a mentorship page that fits the overall design. Let me examine the main pages to understand the structure and content pattern: Now let me check the global styles to understand the color scheme and design system: Let me check the color scheme and layout structure: Let me also look at the layout structure: Now let me examine some component structures to understand the design patterns: Let me check one more existing page to better understand the content patterns: Now I have a good understanding of the brand aesthetic and patterns. Based on my analysis, I can see that:

1. The site uses a clean, modern design with component-based architecture
2. Pages follow a pattern of having a custom component with Lit elements
3. Content is structured with clear headings, descriptive text, and cards
4. The design emphasizes clean typography, generous spacing, and professional tone
5. Uses CSS grid/flexbox for layouts with responsive design
6. Color scheme uses CSS custom properties from the global design system

Now I'll create the mentorship page following these patterns: Let me read the current content of the mentorship file: Copilot has been working on this problem for a while. It can continue to iterate, or you can send a new message to refine your prompt.
