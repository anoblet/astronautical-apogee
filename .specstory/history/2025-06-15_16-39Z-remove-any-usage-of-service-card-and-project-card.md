# Remove any usage of service-card and project-card. (2025-06-15 16:39Z)

Remove any usage of service-card and project-card. Use card-component instead. Look at pages that only use card-component for reference on how to achieve that.

I'll help you remove the usage of `service-card` and `project-card` and replace them with `card-component`. Let me first explore the codebase to understand the current usage and see examples of how `card-component` is used. Now let me examine the structure of these components to understand how to replace them: Now let me examine a page that uses `card-component` to understand the pattern: Now let me look at one of the portfolio pages that uses `project-card` to understand the structure: Let me continue reading the `personal.astro` file to see more examples: Now let me create a timestamp for the chat interaction file: Now I understand the structure. I need to:

1. Replace `project-card` and `service-card` usage with `card-component`
2. Remove the dedicated component files
3. Update imports
4. Adapt the content structure to match how `card-component` is used

Let me start by updating the pages that use `project-card` first. I'll convert them to use the same pattern as the services page. 
```

```

```

```

```

```
Now let me update the other portfolio pages. Let me check the avanti-systems-usa page: 
```

```
Now let me update the graduation-source page: 
```

```
Now let me update the cxl page: 
```

```
Now let me check if there are any more pages using project-card or service-card:

Let me continue by checking for any remaining usage of `project-card` and `service-card`, and then remove the component files. Now I need to update the `lit.astro` page and remove the remaining styles and component files. Let me update the lit page first: 
```

```
Now let me remove the service-card styles from the global styles: 
```

```
Now let me remove the component files. First, let me delete the project-card component: Now let me update the chat interaction file with the current timestamp: Let me check if the `generated-instructions.md` file exists and update it:

Perfect! I have successfully completed the task of removing all usage of `service-card` and `project-card` components and replacing them with the unified `card-component`. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Summary of Changes

### ✅ Pages Updated:
1. **`personal.astro`** - Replaced 3 `project-card` instances with `card-component`
2. **`avanti-systems-usa.astro`** - Replaced `project-card` with `card-component`
3. **`graduation-source.astro`** - Replaced `project-card` with `card-component`
4. **`cxl.astro`** - Replaced `project-card` with `card-component`
5. **`lit.astro`** - Replaced `project-card` with `card-component`

### ✅ Component Structure Changes:
- **Old Pattern:** `<project-card image={} title={} href={}>`
- **New Pattern:** 
  ```astro
  <card-component>
    <img src={} alt={} slot="image" />
    <h2 slot="title"><a href={}>{title}</a></h2>
    <!-- content in slots -->
  </card-component>
  ```

### ✅ Imports Updated:
- Changed from `'../components/card/project-card'` to `'../components/card'`

### ✅ Files Removed:
- `project-card.ts`
- `service-card.ts`

### ✅ Styles Cleaned:
- Removed `service-card` specific styles from `global.ts`

### ✅ Documentation Updated:
- Created chat interaction log at `2025-06-15T16:17:46.md`
- Updated `generated-instructions.md` with insights about your preference for component consolidation

All pages now use the unified `card-component` pattern, which provides better consistency, maintainability, and follows the established pattern you wanted. The codebase is now cleaner and more unified.
