Alphabetize and remove comments from this file

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you alphabetize and remove comments from the `.gitignore` file. Let me first read the current content of the file. Now I'll alphabetize the entries and remove all comments. I'll replace the entire file content with the alphabetized, comment-free version: 
```

```
Perfect! I've successfully:

1. **Removed all comments** - Eliminated all lines starting with `#`
2. **Alphabetized the entries** - Sorted all gitignore patterns alphabetically
3. **Maintained proper formatting** - Kept each entry on its own line with an empty line at the end

The `.gitignore` file is now clean, alphabetized, and comment-free while preserving all the important ignore patterns for your project.
