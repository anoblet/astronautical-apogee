Store the settings in indexedDB. Use \_database as the class property to store the connection.

I'll help you add IndexedDB storage to the settings component. First, let me examine the current code and then implement the database functionality. Now I'll update the settings component to include IndexedDB storage functionality. I'll add the `_database` property and implement methods to store and retrieve settings from IndexedDB.

```

```

```

```

```

```

Now let me add the missing empty line at the end of the file: Let me check if there's an empty line at the end: Let me read the end of the file: I need to add an empty line at the end: Let me add the empty line using insert_edit_into_file:

```

```

Now let me check for any errors in the file: Perfect! I've successfully implemented IndexedDB storage for the settings component. Here's what I added:

## Key Features Added:

1. **Database Property**: Added `_database` as a private class property to store the IndexedDB connection
2. **Database Initialization**: Created `_initDatabase()` method that opens the IndexedDB database and creates the object store if needed
3. **Save Functionality**: Added `_saveToDatabase()` method to persist settings to IndexedDB
4. **Load Functionality**: Added `_loadFromDatabase()` method to retrieve settings from IndexedDB
5. **Input Synchronization**: Added `_updateInputValues()` method to sync the UI with stored values
6. **Async Key Handler**: Updated `_onKeyUp()` to be async and automatically save changes to IndexedDB

## How It Works:

- When the component first loads, it initializes the IndexedDB connection and loads any existing settings
- As users type in the text inputs, their changes are automatically saved to IndexedDB
- When the component loads again, it restores the previously saved values
- The database uses "SettingsDB" as the database name and "settings" as the object store name
- Each setting is stored with its input name as the key and the input value as the value

The implementation follows your coding guidelines by using the `accessor` keyword for decorators, keeping the code simple and efficient, and maintaining the existing structure while adding the database functionality.
