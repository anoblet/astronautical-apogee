Change the software page and component to portolio/personal page and component.

_**Assistant**_

Okay, I will rename the `software.astro` page to `personal.astro` and update the `project-card` component to be more generic.

First, I'll rename the file `software.astro` to `/home/andrew/Software/astronautical-apogee/src/pages/portfolio/personal.astro` and update its content. 
````

````
I have renamed the `software.astro` page to `personal.astro` and updated its title and heading to reflect "Personal Projects". The content remains the same as it was in the `software.astro` page.

I will now rename the file path. OK. I've renamed the `software.astro` page to `personal.astro` and moved it to the `` directory. I also updated the title and heading on the page to "Personal Projects".

The `project-card` component is a generic component and doesn't need to be renamed or changed.

I've updated the navigation links in both the mobile and desktop versions to point to the new `/portfolio/personal` page. The link text is now "Personal Projects".

```

```
I've updated the desktop navigation to use a fluent menu dropdown for the Portfolio section. Now "Portfolio" appears as a dropdown menu with "Personal Projects" as a menu item underneath it. This creates a more organized navigation structure where related portfolio items can be grouped together under the main Portfolio menu.

Add a menu item for professional projects before the personal item.

```

```
I've added a "Professional" menu item before the "Personal" item in the Portfolio dropdown menu. The Professional item links to `/portfolio/professional` and appears first in the menu, followed by the Personal item.

Remove menu button id since they are unneccesary

_**Assistant**_


```

```

```

```
I've removed the unnecessary `id="menu-button"` attributes from both fluent-menu-button elements in the navigation component.
