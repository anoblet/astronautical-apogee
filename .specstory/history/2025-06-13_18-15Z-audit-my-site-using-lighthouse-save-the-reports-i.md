Audit my site using lighthouse. Save the reports in the root directory.

Okay, I can help you with that. First, I need to know the URL of your site that you want to audit. For example, is it running locally like `http://localhost:4321`?

Once I have the URL, I will proceed to:
1. Install Lighthouse globally using pnpm if it's not already available.
2. Run the Lighthouse audit for the provided URL.
3. Save the HTML report in the root directory of your project (``).

Please provide the URL.
