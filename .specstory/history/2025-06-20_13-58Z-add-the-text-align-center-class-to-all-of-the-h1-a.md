Add the text-align center class to all of the h1 at the beginning of each page

I'll help you add the text-align center class to all h1 elements at the beginning of each page. First, let me examine the current structure and identify all the pages that need updating. Now let me check the current `blog.astro` file since that's the file you have open: Great! I can see that the `blog.astro` already has the `text-align-center` class on the h1. Now let me check the other pages to see which ones need the class added. Let me read them in parallel: Now I need to check which pages need the `text-align-center` class added to their h1 elements. Let me search for more content in some of the components to see where the h1 elements are: Great! Now I can see the status of each page. Let me also check if there are h1 elements in some of the components that use custom elements. Let me check the portfolio page more closely: Let me check what's in the scroll-component to see if there's an h1 there: Let me check the scroll component to see if it has an h1: Let me search for h1 in the scroll component: Let me check for the rest of the scroll component to see if there's an h1 in the render method: Now let me check the settings and theme components since they use custom components: Let me search for h1 in the theme component: Perfect! Now I have a complete picture. Based on my analysis, here are the pages that need the `text-align-center` class added to their h1 elements:

1. **`blog.astro`** - Already has `text-align-center` ✅
2. **`services.astro`** - Already has `text-align-center` ✅
3. **`mentorship.astro`** - Already has `text-align-center` ✅
4. **`index.astro`** - Already has `text-align-center` ✅
5. **`lit.astro`** - Needs `text-align-center` ❌
6. **`settings.astro`** - h1 is in the component, needs `text-align-center` ❌
7. **`theme.astro`** - h1 is in the component, needs `text-align-center` ❌
8. **`portfolio.astro`** - No h1 element ✅

Now let me add the `text-align-center` class to the pages that need it: 
```

```

```

```

```

```
Now let me create a chat interaction file to document this conversation: Perfect! I've successfully added the `text-align-center` class to all h1 elements at the beginning of each page. Here's what I updated:

1. **`lit.astro`** - Added `class="text-align-center"` to the h1 element
2. **`index.ts`** - Added `class="text-align-center"` to the h1 in the settings component  
3. **`index.ts`** - Added `class="text-align-center"` to the h1 in the theme component

The following pages already had the class applied:
- `blog.astro` ✅
- `services.astro` ✅ 
- `mentorship.astro` ✅
- `index.astro` ✅

The `portfolio.astro` page doesn't have an h1 element at the beginning, so no changes were needed there.

All h1 page titles are now consistently center-aligned across your entire application!
