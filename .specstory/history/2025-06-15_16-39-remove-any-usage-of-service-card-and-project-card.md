Remove any usage of service-card and project-card. Use card-component instead. Look at pages that only use card-component for reference on how to achieve that.

I'll help you remove the usage of `service-card` and `project-card` and replace them with `card-component`. Let me first explore the codebase to understand the current usage and see examples of how `card-component` is used. Now let me examine the structure of these components to understand how to replace them: Now let me examine a page that uses `card-component` to understand the pattern: Now let me look at one of the portfolio pages that uses `project-card` to understand the structure: Let me continue reading the `personal.astro` file to see more examples: Now let me create a timestamp for the chat interaction file: Now I understand the structure. I need to:

1. Replace `project-card` and `service-card` usage with `card-component`
2. Remove the dedicated component files
3. Update imports
4. Adapt the content structure to match how `card-component` is used

Let me start by updating the pages that use `project-card` first. I'll convert them to use the same pattern as the services page.

Now let me update the other portfolio pages. Let me check the avanti-systems-usa page: 
```

```
Now let me update the graduation-source page: 
```

```
Now let me update the cxl page: 
```

```
Now let me check if there are any more pages using project-card or service-card:

Let me continue by checking for any remaining usage of `project-card` and `service-card`, and then remove the component files. Now I need to update the `lit.astro` page and remove the remaining styles and component files. Let me update the lit page first: 
```

```
Now let me remove the service-card styles from the global styles: 
```

```
Now let me remove the component files. First, let me delete the project-card component: Now let me update the chat interaction file with the current timestamp: Let me check if the `generated-instructions.md` file exists and update it:
