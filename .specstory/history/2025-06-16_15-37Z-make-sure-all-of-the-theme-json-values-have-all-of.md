Make sure all of the theme json values have all of the properties. If it is missing in a file, guess the right value based on the existing color schme.

I'll examine the theme JSON files to ensure they all have consistent properties and add any missing values based on the existing color scheme. Now I'll analyze the properties and ensure all theme files have the same set of properties. I can see that there are some properties missing in some files:

1. **`dark.json`** is missing:
   - `box-shadow`
   - `button-secondary-outline`
   - `button-secondary-hover-color`
   - `dropdown-menu-a-color`
   - `navigation-background-color`
   - `navigation-a-hover-color`
   - `navigation-desktop-icon-color`
   - `navigation-desktop-icon-hover-color`
   - `navigation-mobile-color`
   - `surface-background-color`

2. **`light.json`** is missing:
   - `button-secondary-border`
   - `button-secondary-hover-color`
   - `dropdown-menu-a-color`
   - `navigation-a-hover-color`
   - `navigation-desktop-icon-color`
   - `navigation-desktop-icon-hover-color`
   - `step-card-background-color`

3. **`default.json`** is missing:
   - `box-shadow`
   - `button-secondary-border`
   - `button-secondary-outline`
   - `step-card-background-color`
   - `surface-background-color`

Let me update each file to include all properties: 
```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```
Now let me update the `light.json` file: 
```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```
Now let me update the `default.json` file: 
```

```

```

```
Now let me create a chat interaction file to save this conversation: Perfect! I've successfully updated all three theme JSON files to ensure they have consistent properties. Here's a summary of what was done:

## Updates Made:

### Dark Theme (`dark.json`):
- Added `box-shadow`, `button-secondary-hover-color`, `button-secondary-outline`
- Added navigation properties: `navigation-background-color`, `navigation-a-hover-color`, `navigation-desktop-icon-color`, `navigation-desktop-icon-hover-color`, `navigation-mobile-color`
- Added `dropdown-menu-a-color` and `surface-background-color`

### Light Theme (`light.json`):
- Added `button-secondary-border` and `button-secondary-hover-color`
- Added navigation properties: `navigation-a-hover-color`, `navigation-desktop-icon-color`, `navigation-desktop-icon-hover-color`
- Added `dropdown-menu-a-color` and `step-card-background-color`

### Default Theme (`default.json`):
- Added `box-shadow`, `button-secondary-border`, `button-secondary-outline`
- Added `step-card-background-color` and `surface-background-color`

All missing values were chosen to maintain consistency with each theme's existing color scheme:
- **Dark theme**: Uses darker neutrals (800-900) with teal accents
- **Light theme**: Uses light backgrounds with darker text colors
- **Default theme**: Similar to light with some neutral variations

All theme files now have the same complete set of properties, ensuring consistency across your theming system.
