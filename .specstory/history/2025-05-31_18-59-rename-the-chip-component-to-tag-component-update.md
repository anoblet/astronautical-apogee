Rename the chip-component to tag-component. Update all usages.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you rename `chip-component` to `tag-component` and update all its usages. Let me first search for all occurrences of `chip-component` in the codebase. Now let me search for any other portfolio files to see if they also use `chip-component`: Let me check the other portfolio files for chip-component usage: Now let me check the actual chip component file to understand its structure: Now I need to check if there are any imports or references to the chip file specifically: Let me also check the portfolio page to see if it uses chip-component: Now I'll start the renaming process. I need to:

1. Update the component file itself (`chip.ts`) to rename the custom element and class
2. Update all the usage files to use `tag-component` instead of `chip-component`

Let's start with the component file:

```

```

Now let's update the CXL portfolio page:

```

```

Now let's update the Avanti Systems USA portfolio page:

```

```

Now let's update the Graduation Source portfolio page:

```

```

Now let's update the software page. First, let me read it to see the current structure:

```

```

```

```

Perfect! I've successfully renamed `chip-component` to `tag-component` throughout the codebase. Here's a summary of what I changed:

## Files Updated:

1. **`chip.ts`**

   - Changed `@customElement("chip-component")` to `@customElement("tag-component")`
   - Renamed class from `ChipCmponent` to `TagComponent`

2. **`cxl.astro`**

   - Replaced all `<chip-component>` tags with `<tag-component>`

3. **`avanti-systems-usa.astro`**

   - Replaced all `<chip-component>` tags with `<tag-component>`

4. **`graduation-source.astro`**

   - Replaced all `<chip-component>` tags with `<tag-component>`

5. **`software.astro`**
   - Replaced all `<chip-component>` tags with `<tag-component>`

The component functionality remains exactly the same - only the custom element name has been changed from `chip-component` to `tag-component`. All the imports (`@components/chip`) remain the same since the file name hasn't changed, just the custom element name and class name within the file.

Update class names and slot names as well.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll update the class names and slot names to be consistent with the `tag-component` naming. Let me first check what class names and slot names are currently being used. Now let me check the project-card component to see its current slot structure: Now let me check the global styles to see if there are any chip-related styles: Now I need to update all the references to rename from "chips" to "tags" consistently. Let me start with the component file:

```

```

Now let me update the global styles:

```

```

Now I'll update all the portfolio pages. Starting with the CXL page:

```

```

Wait, I need to fix that - I accidentally changed the class but kept the slot name as "chips". Let me correct that: It looks like it's already correct. Let me check the current state of the file: It seems the file got corrupted. Let me read the full file to see its current state: The file got corrupted during the edit. I need to fix it by recreating the proper structure: Let me replace the entire corrupted content:

```

```

Let me try a different approach - just fix the slot attributes: Good, it looks like the CXL file is already fixed. Now let me update the `graduation-source.astro` file:

```

```

Now let me update the `avanti-systems-usa.astro` file:

```

```

Now let me update the `software.astro` file. First let me read its current structure: Let me update the first project card in software.astro: Copilot has been working on this problem for a while. It can continue to iterate, or you can send a new message to refine your prompt.

I need to continue fixing the corrupted `software.astro` file. Let me check its current state and fix it properly. The file is corrupted. Let me get the original version and fix it completely. First, let me check if there's a `lit.astro` file that might have the correct structure: I need to check the git history to see what the `software.astro` file should look like. Let me try to reconstruct it based on the pattern. Let me run git status first to see if there are changes: I see the `software.astro` file is severely corrupted. Let me restore it by rewriting it completely:
