Update `.github/instructions/generated-instructions` with current patterns. Remove old patterns.

---

_**Assistant**_

Okay, I will update the `generated-instructions.md` file with the current patterns and remove any old ones.

First, I need to gather all the current patterns. I'll read the content of the following files:
1.  `lit.instructions.md`
2.  `/home/andrew/Software/astronautical-apogee/instructions/style.instructions.md`
3.  `INSTRUCTIONS.md`
4.  And the file to be updated, to see its current content: `generated-instructions.md`

Then, I will consolidate these with the instructions you've provided directly in this session.
 Okay, I will update the `generated-instructions.md` file with the current patterns and remove old ones.

Based on the information I have, here's a consolidated list of instructions:

*   **General:**
    *   Keep it simple.
    *   Remove unnecessary comments.
    *   Do not add comments.
    *   Always include an empty line at the end of the file.
    *   Emphasize decoupling.
    *   Avoid page-specific CSS classes.
    *   Use utility CSS classes available in the global stylesheet when possible.
    *   Do your best to not modify existing logic and or definitions, though update it when necessary.
    *   The goal of the structure should be to be reusable.
    *   Keep your changes as minimal as possible.
    *   Always ask if you are unsure of anything.
    *   Save every chat interaction in `chats/[timestamp].md`. Update the file with the chat interaction after every message until the conversation ends.
    *   Use the following format for the chat interaction file:
        ```
        # Chat Interaction - [timestamp]

        ## User Message
        [User's message here]

        ## Assistant Response
        [Assistant's response here]

        ## Insights
        [Any insights or observations about user preferences and behavior]
        ```
    *   After every interaction with the user through the chat interface, update `generated-instructions.md` with insights on user preferences and behavior.
    *   Your first step is to start the development server, keep it running, and use the output to fix any errors that may occur. Start a new terminal if you need to run any additional commands.
    *   This project uses Astro JS, Lit, and Fluent UI.
    *   Create a portfolio site for a software developer. The Github profile is: https://github.com/anoblet/
    *   Include a services page, and a projects page. The three projects are [CXL](https://cxl.com/), [Graduation Source](https://graduationsource.com/), and [Avanti Systems USA](https://avantisystemsusa.com). Analyze the websites and come up with the appropriate description for a software developer.

*   **Components & Layout:**
    *   Create as many new components as necessary.
    *   Components should be simple and composable.
    *   Move as much reusable structure to the layout as possible.
    *   Astro is used for layouts and pages, emphasizing componentization and reusability.
    *   Layouts centralize shared structure (headers, footers, global elements) and use slots for content.
    *   Web Components (LitElement) are used for interactive UI; Astro components for static/layout elements.
    *   Components are minimal, with logic and structure separated for reusability.
    *   Shared base classes and utilities provide common functionality and styles.
    *   Project structure is organized for clarity, with clear separation between assets, components, layouts, and pages.
    *   The codebase is designed for maintainability and extensibility, focusing on composability and DRY principles.

*   **Styling:**
    *   Use CSS variables whenever possible.
    *   Always adhere to the global color scheme.
    *   Always make the CSS rules as efficient as possible.
    *   Styles are always scoped to the component.
    *   It's possible to target elements directly, without needing to specify a parent class (e.g., `h1`).
    *   Styles should be as atomic as possible in order to provide brand continuity.
    *   Use the color scheme from `styles/global.ts`.
    *   CSS variables are used for colors, spacing, and typography, supporting a global color scheme and theming.
    *   Styles are modular: global styles in `global.css`/`colors.css` (Note: `styles/global.ts` was mentioned, `colors.css` is from previous generated instructions, `styles/colors.css` exists in the workspace), scoped styles in components.
    *   Responsive design is implemented with flexbox, grid, and media queries.
    *   Interactive elements have clear hover/focus states.
    *   Use a dark background (`#333`), with the following colors as accents (`#19f9d8`, `#45a9f9`). Make the aesthetic modern and minimal.

*   **TypeScript/JavaScript:**
    *   Decorators need the `accessor` keyword.

*   **HTML:**
    *   Semantic HTML is prioritized for accessibility.
    *   Accessibility is considered via semantic HTML and ARIA roles where appropriate.

*   **Navigation (Specific to `INSTRUCTIONS.md`):**
    *   Create a new navigation component. It should be inside the header component. It should use a hamburger menu icon on mobile, and tabs on desktop. There should be Github, LinkedIn, and Email icons on the right hand side.

*   **User Preferences (from previous generated instructions):**
    *   User expects strict adherence to instructions, including those for logging chat interactions and deriving insights. User is direct in pointing out deviations from instructions. User confirmed that the proposed timestamp mechanism (current date and time for the log file name) and the proposed insight are acceptable.

I will now update the `generated-instructions.md` file.

The `generated-instructions.md` file has been updated with the current patterns and old patterns have been removed. The instructions from your user instructions, `INSTRUCTIONS.md`, and the previous `generated-instructions.md` have been consolidated.
