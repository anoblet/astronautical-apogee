## User Message
Analyze the entire workspace. Give me suggestions on how I could simplify the project.

## Assistant Response
Performed comprehensive analysis of the astronautical-apogee workspace and identified major simplification opportunities:

### Major Issues Found:
1. **FluentUI Overhead**: 500KB+ bundle weight for minimal usage (navigation menus, text inputs)
2. **Duplicate Functionality**: services.astro + services.ts doing same thing
3. **Over-componentization**: 41 TS files for components, many very small
4. **Complex GenAIScript Setup**: Full workspace with git repo for simple AI tooling
5. **Repetitive Content**: Multiple similar portfolio pages that could be data-driven

### Recommendations (Priority Order):
1. Replace FluentUI with native HTML/lightweight components (40-50% bundle reduction)
2. Consolidate duplicate pages and similar portfolio pages
3. Simplify GenAIScript to basic scripts folder
4. Unify card components (project-card vs card-component)
5. Reduce component granularity and consolidate icons

### Current State:
- Bundle: 2.8MB
- Files: 22 Astro + 41 TypeScript
- Performance score: 0.5 due to bundle size

Provided detailed implementation priorities and specific technical recommendations.

## Insights
