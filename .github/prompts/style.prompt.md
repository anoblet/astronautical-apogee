- Ensure CSS variables are grouped logically (e.g., colors, fonts, spacing) and documented for clarity and maintainability.
- Use fallback values for CSS variables to ensure compatibility with older browsers.
- Avoid hardcoding color values directly in styles; always use defined CSS variables for consistency.
- Ensure all font imports are optimized and only include necessary weights and styles to reduce load time.
- Use semantic HTML elements and ensure styles align with their intended purpose for better accessibility.
- Avoid using overly generic selectors that might unintentionally affect other elements.
- Use a consistent naming convention for CSS classes, such as BEM (Block Element Modifier), to improve readability and maintainability.
- Minimize the use of `!important` to avoid specificity issues and maintain clean cascading styles.
- Regularly audit and remove unused CSS rules to keep the stylesheet lean and efficient.
- Test styles across multiple browsers and devices to ensure consistent rendering.
- Use media queries to ensure responsive design and test styles on various screen sizes.
- Document the purpose of complex or non-obvious CSS rules to aid future developers.
- Ensure all interactive elements (e.g., links, buttons) have clear hover and focus states for better user experience.
- Use CSS preprocessors like SCSS or PostCSS for better organization and maintainability of stylesheets.
- Optimize animations and transitions for performance, avoiding excessive use of heavy effects.
- Ensure all styles adhere to the project's theming system, supporting both light and dark modes.
- Use tools like CSS linting or formatting to enforce consistent style rules and detect potential issues.
- Regularly review and update the CSS style guide to align with evolving best practices and project requirements.
