### V1

- Contributing is more satisfying than implementing
- Ideas are more powerful than skill
- Those who contribute are better positioned to identify inefficiencies as opposed to those who implement.
- Contributing creatively as opposed to implementing means the developer has a stake in the product
- It's important your employees _are_ stakeholders
- Those who contribute as opposed to implement, are more invested in the product's success.
