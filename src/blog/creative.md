### Why you should let your developers get creative

Unlocking developer creativity isn’t just good for morale—it’s a catalyst for innovation and growth. When developers are empowered to think beyond the task list, they bring fresh perspectives, drive meaningful change, and help your product stand out.

- We have a lot of great ideas,
- Everyone loves to feel smart.
- Contributing is more satisfying than implementing
- Ideas are more powerful than skill
- Those who contribute are better positioned to identify inefficiencies as opposed to those who implement.
- Contributing creatively as opposed to implementing means the developer has a stake in the product
- It's important your employees _are_ stakeholders
- Those who contribute as opposed to implement, are more invested in the product's success.
